### Deployment
The web app is deployed on [Google Cloud](https://august-storm-319410.el.r.appspot.com/).

## User Stories
The project was built on an agile-scrum methodology which tried to address the following user stories:
- As a member of the Ace Hacker Team, I want the mandatory feature of video-call to connect at least two users.
- As a student, I want the feature of mute/unmute the mic and also switch on/off the video.
- As a Govt Employee, I want the feature to allow and disallow people to join the meeting.
- As a surprise feature the Stake-Holder (Ace Hacker ü§®), has asked to include a meeting chat feature that can be followed once the meeting is done.
- As a Developer, I want only verified users to use the product.
- As a Senior Software Engineer, I want the site to be personalized and interactive with an appealing user interface.

## Features
1. #### Video Call
    - The home page has options to **start** a new meeting or **join** an ongoing meeting using the **meeting link**.
    - Participants have an option to copy the **meeting link** using a button.
    - The **meeting organizer** has on option to **admit** or **deny** the entry of someone trying to join the meet.
    - The **Control Tray** at the bottom provides the following features:
        - Copy the meeting link
        - Mute/unmute the mic

3. #### Chat

    As soon as a **meeting starts**, a separate chat is created in which all the participants are added as and when they join the meet. The users can **not only** chat during the meeting but also continue to chat once the meeting ends. The meeting chat allows the user to only send messages while the following features are provided in the chat **after** the meeting ends:
    - The **organizer** has the option to add and remove users from the chat.
    - The chat supports all the **typographic emphasis** options including **bold**, *italics* and ```code segments```. Apart from that, the option to upload a picture or a file is also present.
    - The status of whether someone is typing
    - Online and Offline users.
    - Delete a conversation (chat).
    - Create new chats: This allows the users of the web app to create separate conversation channels and communicate with each other.

4. #### Micro-Interactions and User Experience
    The following features ensure that each user has an enriching experience:
    - Single-page application without reloads ensures zero response time.
    - Welcome Message customized to the name of the user at the top right of the home page.
    - Alert on entering an invalid meeting link.
    - Welcome notification on joining the meeting.
    - Notification to tell the user that the meeting link is copied.
    - Notification prompting the user that the message in the meeting chat cannot be blank.
    - Customized Alert Dialog box tells the user in case the connection fails.
    - Lastly, the Goodbye message appears when the user log's out of the web application.

## Implementation and the Agile Workflow

The development in this project had adopted an Agile Scrum methodology. Since it was in individual project, every role of the development team was done my the author himself. However, the user stories were taken as a feedback from family members, friends, mentors and also by the features as suggested by the Ace Hacker team. The overall development included three sprints:

#### Sprint 1:

The focus of this sprint was to implement the mandatory feature with some additional features too. It can be summarized as:

![screenshot](./screenshots/Sprint_1.png)

#### Sprint 2:

The focus of this sprint was to implement the authentication feature along with building the front-end of the web-site. It can be summarized as:

![screenshot](./screenshots/Sprint_2.png)

#### Sprint 3:

The focus of this sprint was to implement the surprise feature announced by Ace Hacker along with feature of admit/deny. It can be summarized as:

## What did the project acheive
- Every sprint was able to acheive it's own definition of **Done** and was therefore successful in building the mentioned features in the feature section.
- Apart from that this project has given a real good insight regarding one of the development methodologies Microsoft uses to build some of it's products (i.e. **Agile Scrum**).
- The interaction with the mentors of Microsoft and representatives from the Ace Hacker team were insightful and helped a lot in structuring the workflow and overall development of the project.

## Further Scope
- The major backlog of Sprint 3 is to improvise on the User Interface of the Chat feature.
- Apart from that features such as White-Board and IP Call can be added in future sprints to make the product more usable.
- Lastly, as more and more users are added **bugs** would keep popping in and **User Stories** would add on which would form a basis for further sprints.
